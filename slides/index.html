				<h1>1. File late. </H1>
					<p>Like, really late.If you want to score bonus points, file after 4PM.</p>
			</section>


			<section>
				<H1>2. File on the same thing that everyone else is filing on.</H1>
				<p> But, and this is important: DO NOT BE THE FIRST REPORTER TO FILE A STORY ON THE TOPIC. Give other news organizations at least 2 hours lead time online.</p>
			</section>

				<section>
				<H1>3. Mitigate Twitter Risk</H1>
				<p>If you want to make sure your story doesn't get seen, but you still want to use Twitter to talk to other journalists, here are a few tips.</p>
</section>

			<section>
					<H1>Avoid consistency.</H1>
					<p>Tweet twelve times in an hour. Then go radio silent for a week.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<H1>Don't use links. </H1>
					<p>If you want to tweet about your story but be sure no one sees it, it's easy: just don't link to it.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<H1>Link to other news organizations' sites, but not your own</H1>
					<p>For bonus points, tweet links to news stories from other news organizations. If people ask you if you work there, you're doing it right.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<H1>Live tweet...but don't follow up</H1>
					<p>Livetweet from a breaking news story if you must. But never follow up with a link, or give people the impression that there might be a link coming.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section>
				<H1>4. Challenge yourself to do a story with no news hook at all.</H1>
			</section>
<section>
			<section>
				<H1>5. Don't take photos.</H1>
				<p>But if you have to, here are a few tips.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<H1>People love faces. Make sure no one can see one. </H1>
				<p>If you must take a picture, be sure your subject is centered in the photo, far away, backlit, and has a facial expression not appropriate to the story's theme.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<H1>Write a great story. Then illustrate it with a picture of a building.</H1>
				<p>A stock photo of city hall is okay, but only if you can't get a bad picture of City Hall at night taken with your phone.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<H1>Use CMS camouflage.</H1>
				<p>Pick a photo from the CMS that's being used for another story on the same day on the same topic. The reader will be too confused to know there's a new story!</p>
			</section>


			<section>
				<H1>Choose a picture that makes people recoil.</H1>
				<p>Make sure they know not to go anywhere near your story with a picture that makes them unfollow you completely.</p>
			</section>

		</section>

			<section>
				<H1>6. Write a bad headline.</H1>
				<p>Once you're sure you've got a bad headline, add six words to it.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<H1>7. Don't talk to the digital team.</H1>
				<p>The digital team will probably do things like get better lead art for you, social, graphics, etc. Huge risk!</p>
			</section>
